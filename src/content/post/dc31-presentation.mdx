## (Threat Hunting) "(n)Map Exploration: A Great Time in Remote Destinations"

Let's take a look at activity within a corporate environment. Can we find actions that stand out or might be suspicious?

# Overview

## What will we learn?
There are a number of concepts we will go over and learn in this walkthrough:

* What is reconnaissance in a security/threat hunt context?
* What are some ways that adversaries can identify points of exploitation within an environment?
* What are some commonly abused services that adversaries use?
* How can we walk through the thought process associated with a Threat Hunt from hypothesis to tangible results?
* What tools do we have at our disposal and what can we do with them?
* Can we go deeper and find out more after validating our hypothesis?

# Initial Required Concepts
In order to dive into the hunt, we need to have some baseline information to better understand what we are seeking to find. Let us take a look at some of these now.

## What is reconnaissance?
In a security context, reconnaissance is the process of gathering information about a particular target. It's important to recognize that reconnaissance is *not* always malicious in nature. It is not unexpected or unheard of to see some tools in use within the organization that perform this activity. Reconnaissance is often utilized prior to potential exploitation as an adversary would build out a "map" of items that exists in a particular environment.

## What are some ways that adversaries can identify points of exploitation?
An adversary can begin with some basic web searches to find information that is freely available on the internet to begin building a model associated with a particular "entity" - often in this context the "entity" is an organization. We call this freely-available information on the internet Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT for short. There is often a limit to the usefulness of the information provided by OSINT resources as it pertains to actively using it against an entity. 

## What if the adversary is already connected to the network?
If the adversary already has a limited foothold into the network, there are more effective things that the adversary can do:
* Build a network map of the environment - what systems are there? what operating systems are there?
* Identify services that the adversary could then utilize to move deeper into systems/the network.
* Exfiltrate data

From a security point of view, we call this building a list of systems "Enumeration"

## What tools could be used to do this enumeration within the network?
Some tools for this include:
* Network Scanning Tools: Used for building out systems associated with a particular network, including open ports, operating system type, and more. A few examples of applications in this group include the popular tool nmap and as well masscan.
* Vulnerability Scanners: OpenVAS/Nessus are two vulnerability scanners that could theoretically be used to identify hosts within a network.
* Built-in OS Tools: The ping tool could be used to identify available hosts within a network, though

**Now that we understand more about reconnaissance, let's put these concepts together to see if we can build a Threat Hunt with these ideas in mind!**

# Threat Hunting

## What is Threat Hunting?
Threat Hunting (TH) is a process of being proactive of unveiling unknown-knowns and unknown-unknowns to better our security posture

# Hypothesis
In order to begin the Threat Hunt, we need to have a reason to start the hunt. To start, we will need to come up with a hypothesis.

### What is a hypothesis?
   A hypothesis can be described as something we think might be occurring or something that we think might be taking place in an environment. A hypothesis focuses on the 6 W's:
   
   * Who: Who is doing the activity?
   * What: What is happening?
   * Where: Where (What systems/networks) is this happening?
   * When: What time/time period did this happen?
   * Why: What is the end goal for the activity being performed?
   * How: How is the activity occurring in the system?
   
   ### How do we create a hypothesis?
   For HOW to create a hypothesis for Threat Hunting, you can read an in-depth guide here: (insert link). 
   
   For now we will go over the hypothesis I have created for this scenario.
   
   Let's create a hypothesis to hunt for reconnaissance!

   ### Broad Hypothesis
   The company has reconnaissance activity within the network.
  
   ### Narrow hypothesis
   Reconnaissance activity is occurring in the Magnum Tempus environment, and some of the activity is malicious.

# Transitioning from a Hypothesis to a Query

## How can we formulate a query based on our hypothesis?
Our initial hypothesis presumes that there is reconnaissance activity within the environment. While this is most certainly true, we need to dig deeper. There may indeed be this ocurring, but as we noted above, not all reconnaissance activity is outright malicious.

First we need to understand what tools we have available. For this Hunt, we are using Splunk, however many of the procedures/methods we use can and should be used with other query languages/log platforms.

Since we know our log data is in Splunk, we first need to determine what log sources we have available to us. 

We could modify our index to include ALL log source data using a wildcard query like this:

```
index="*"
```

HOWEVER, this is considered **bad practice** as doing so is an expensive (resource-intensive) query and could cause undesirable effects on the Splunk (or other Log Aggregator) server and could hinder other searches being done on the system.

Thanks to our friend, [Cereal Killer](https://github.com/blueteamvillage/obsidian-threat-hunting/blob/first-draft/KC3/Sniffing_Compromise_Cereal.md), we can utilize the following query to find the indexes (source) of data to query against:

```
| eventcount summarize=false index=* | dedup index | fields index
```

While you may not know this, when I think of nmap usage, I think of it being used on Linux distributions. As we can see above, there is an index for Linux, so let's start there!

In Splunk queries, we start by calling the index (source) of the data we are querying against:

```
index="linux"
```
We can query with just this, however we will get ALL data in the associated log:

> NOTE: 
> We need to change the time filter to the time period we are checking against for this specific scenario because we don't know exactly when the log data starts/stops.
> In your own Threat Hunting (outside of this scenario), you will want to identify a timeframe to conduct your searches. This could be 24 Hours, 1 Week, 1 Month.

In this scenario for this hunt, we are focusing on the whole day of 2023-04-29.

In Linux, an example of a basic host nmap scan command line entry would look like this:

>nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

To make it easier, we can expand on our existing query and add just the text "nmap" to it, since the nmap application is just simply *nmap*.

```
index="linux" (nmap)
```
