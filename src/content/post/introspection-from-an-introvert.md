On the eve before I issue final exams for my students in my class, I'm taking some time to reflect on lessons learned as a first-time instructor:

1. Some say the best way for you to learn something is to teach someone else

This is true. There are many concepts that I might not have understood (as my normal day-to-day work does not deal directly with it) but I was able to gain insight into these topics to a degree that I feel far more comfortable discussing them.

2. You know far more than you think you know

One of my biggest hurdles in actually accepting the opportunity to teach was being worried about the fact that I wouldn't have enough material to cover the time allotted for the class. Fortunately/Unfortunately, I learned that this was not the case, and I ended up getting to a point to where I had too much material and not enough time to cover everything I wanted to.
3. Students will surprise you in surprising ways

I know I have a passion for information security, and in some sense education. Working in information security, you will learn that what you consider a priority will not always match in priority with others within the business. This is true as well when dealing with students in an academic setting. I have had students ask me about scenarios related to their employment: ways to get management to buy into implementing better security. I've had students give bare minimum, but far more give above and beyond.

4. Be EXTREMELY CLEAR in your expectations of students and try to not leave too much up to interpretation.

I've learned a few things this semester from students. Students will wait until the last minute to turn something in. Whether or not you accept it is another question. Students will ask what types of questions will be on exams - this one took me by surprise: I just presumed you prepared by understanding the material, not the type/method of exam.

5. It's easy to drone on about boring topics, so change it up!

Yes, we need the basics before diving into deeper topics, but one key thought I now have is to incorporate demonstrations for different things I'm teaching. If I had the ability to redo this semester, I would incorporate much more of the hands-on - my students really, REALLY seemed to enjoy this aspect.

6. You don't have to know EVERYTHING

One thing I know is that I don't know everything. It's okay to admit you don't know something, but be willing to work to find an answer. I had several questions that stumped me, but I was able to find the answers and get the information to the students
Final Notes

All in all, it was definitely an amazing experience and one that has opened my eyes to further teaching in this industry. I'm looking forward to my next opportunity to share my knowledge with others.
